# Suicidal ideation

```{r results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo = FALSE, cache = TRUE}
suicidal <- split_data(original, "SUICIDAL IDEATION/BEHAVIOUR or SELF HARM") #total number of events is 365
model1 <- do_meta_analysis(suicidal)
model2 <- do_MH_NMA(suicidal) 
model3 <- do_MH_NMA(suicidal, method = "Inverse")
model4 <- do_MH_NMA(suicidal, method = "Inverse", random.effects = TRUE)
```

## Network graph

We included a total of `r length(model1$studlab)` studies in the analysis of this outcome. We had a total of `r sum(model1$event.c)` events in placebo and `r sum(model1$event.e)` events in drugs.

```{r, fig.height=10, fig.width=10}
netgraph(model2, seq = "optimal", col = "black", plastic = FALSE, points = TRUE, pch = 21, cex.points = 3,
         col.points = "black", bg.points = "gray", thickness = "se.fixed", multiarm = FALSE, number.of.studies = TRUE)
```

## Pairwise meta-analysis

After grouping all drugs under one node, we performed a pairwise meta-analysis between drugs vs placebo. We used Mantel-Haenszel method to synthesize odds ratios. We found a very small effect size with large uncertainty, i.e. an OR 1.07 [0.82, 1.38], favouring placebo. The random effects model gave almost identical results.

```{r}
summary(model1)
```

We present contour-enhanced funnel plot. We don't see asymmetry in the funnel plot. Thus, we can conclude that there is no publication bias in this study.

```{r}
funnel(model1, pch = 16,
       contour = c(0.9, 0.95, 0.99),
       col.contour = c("green", "yellow", "pink"))
legend(2, 0,
       c("0.1 > p > 0.05", "0.05 > p > 0.01", "< 0.01"),
       fill = c("green", "yellow", "pink"), bty = "n")
```

## Mantel-Haenszel network meta-analysis

We performed a Mantel-Haenszel NMA. Results are summarized in the forest plot below. Odds ratio smaller than 1 indicate that a drug reduced suicidal ideation as compared to placebo. All estimates come with large uncertainty; thus, no firm conclusion can be drawn for any of the drugs.

```{r}
forest(model2, sortvar = model2$TE.fixed[,which(colnames(model2$TE.fixed)=="placebo")])
```

## Inverse variance network meta-analysis

The estimates found by using inverse variance method for both fixed and random effects model closely match the result we found in Mantel-Haenszel NMA. There are more treatments included in this NMA since a continuity correction (adding 0.5 to no event arms) has been used. Fixed and random effects NMA gave identical results, because heterogeneity was estimated to be zero.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
forest(model3, sortvar = model3$TE.fixed[,which(colnames(model3$TE.fixed)=="placebo")])
```

# Nausea

```{r results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo = FALSE, cache = TRUE}
nausea <- split_data(original, "NAUSEA") 
nausea <- nausea[!(nausea["No_randomised"] < nausea["martha_outcome"]),]

aa <- table(nausea["StudyID"])
nausea <- nausea[!apply(nausea["StudyID"], 2, trimws) %in% names(aa[aa == 1]),]

sum(nausea$martha_outcome[nausea$Drug == "placebo"])
sum(nausea$No_randomised[nausea$Drug == "placebo"])
sum(nausea$martha_outcome[nausea$Drug != "placebo"])
sum(nausea$No_randomised[nausea$Drug != "placebo"])


model5 <- do_meta_analysis(nausea)
model6 <- do_MH_NMA(nausea, method = "Inverse", random.effects = TRUE)
```


## Network graph

We included a total of `r length(model5$studlab)` studies in the analysis of this outcome. We had a total of `r round(sum(model5$event.c))` events in placebo and `r round(sum(model5$event.e))` events in drugs.

```{r, fig.height=10, fig.width=10}
netgraph(model6, seq = "optimal", col = "black", plastic = FALSE, points = TRUE, pch = 21, cex.points = 3,
         col.points = "black", bg.points = "gray", thickness = "se.fixed", multiarm = FALSE, number.of.studies = TRUE)
```

## Pairwise meta-analysis

After grouping all drugs under one node, we performed a pairwise meta-analysis between drugs vs placebo. We used Mantel-Haenszel method to synthesize odds ratios. We found a very **large** effect size with small uncertainty, i.e. an OR 2.59 [2.46, 2.74], favouring placebo.

```{r}
summary(model5)
```

We present contour-enhanced funnel plot below. We don't see asymmetry in the funnel plot. Thus, we can conclude that there is no publication bias in this study.

```{r}
funnel(model5, pch = 16,
       contour = c(0.9, 0.95, 0.99),
       col.contour = c("green", "yellow", "pink"))
legend(8, 0,
       c("0.1 > p > 0.05", "0.05 > p > 0.01", "< 0.01"),
       fill = c("green", "yellow", "pink"), bty = "n")
```


## Random effects network meta-analysis

We performed a random effects NMA. Results are summarized in the forest plot below. Odds ratio smaller than 1 indicate that a drug reduced nausea as compared to placebo. Odds ratios are much greater than 1 with small uncertainty; thus, we can infer that drug may be developing nausea for some patients.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
forest(model6, sortvar = model6$TE.random[,which(colnames(model6$TE.random)=="placebo")])
```


# Agitation

```{r results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo = FALSE, cache = TRUE}
agitation <- split_data(original, "AGITATION") 
model7 <- do_meta_analysis(agitation)
model8 <- do_MH_NMA(agitation, method = "Inverse", random.effects = TRUE)
```


## Network graph

We included a total of `r length(model7$studlab)` studies in the analysis of this outcome. We had a total of `r round(sum(model7$event.c))` events in placebo and `r round(sum(model7$event.e))` events in drugs.

```{r, fig.height=10, fig.width=10}
netgraph(model8, seq = "optimal", col = "black", plastic = FALSE, points = TRUE, pch = 21, cex.points = 3,
         col.points = "black", bg.points = "gray", thickness = "se.fixed", multiarm = FALSE, number.of.studies = TRUE)
```

## Pairwise meta-analysis

After grouping all drugs under one node, we performed a pairwise meta-analysis between drugs vs placebo. We used Mantel-Haenszel method to synthesize odds ratios. We found a small effect size with moderate uncertainty, i.e. an OR 1.17 [0.99, 1.40], favouring placebo. 


```{r}
summary(model7)
```

We present contour-enhanced funnel plot below. We don't see asymmetry in the funnel plot. Thus, we can conclude that there is no publication bias in this study.


```{r}
funnel(model7, pch = 16,
       contour = c(0.9, 0.95, 0.99),
       col.contour = c("green", "yellow", "pink"))
legend(2, 0,
       c("0.1 > p > 0.05", "0.05 > p > 0.01", "< 0.01"),
       fill = c("green", "yellow", "pink"), bty = "n")
```


## Random effects network meta-analysis

We performed a random effects NMA. Results are summarized in the forest plot below. Odds ratio smaller than 1 indicate that a drug reduced agitation as compared to placebo. All estimates come with large uncertainty; thus, no firm conclusion can be drawn for any of the drugs.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 5, fig.width = 5}
forest(model8, sortvar = model8$TE.random[,which(colnames(model8$TE.random)=="placebo")])
```


# Tremor

```{r results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, echo = FALSE, cache = TRUE}
tremor <- split_data(original, "TREMOR") 
model9 <- do_meta_analysis(tremor)
model10 <- do_MH_NMA(tremor, method = "Inverse", random.effects = TRUE)
```


## Network graph

We included a total of `r length(model9$studlab)` studies in the analysis of this outcome. We had a total of `r round(sum(model9$event.c))` events in placebo and `r round(sum(model9$event.e))` events in drugs.

```{r, fig.height=10, fig.width=10}
netgraph(model10, seq = "optimal", col = "black", plastic = FALSE, points = TRUE, pch = 21, cex.points = 3,
         col.points = "black", bg.points = "gray", thickness = "se.fixed", multiarm = FALSE, number.of.studies = TRUE)
```

## Pairwise meta-analysis

After grouping all drugs under one node, we performed a pairwise meta-analysis between drugs vs placebo. We used Mantel-Haenszel method to synthesize odds ratios. We found a large effect size with small uncertainty, i.e. an OR 4.22 [3.50, 5.10], favouring placebo. 

```{r}
summary(model9)
```

We present contour-enhanced funnel plot below. There might be a publication bias since studies with low precision are not spread evenly on both sides of the average.

```{r}
funnel(model9, pch = 16,
       contour = c(0.9, 0.95, 0.99),
       col.contour = c("green", "yellow", "pink"))
legend(10, 0,
       c("0.1 > p > 0.05", "0.05 > p > 0.01", "< 0.01"),
       fill = c("green", "yellow", "pink"), bty = "n")
```


## Random effects network meta-analysis

We performed a random effects NMA. Results are summarized in the forest plot below. Odds ratio smaller than 1 indicate that a drug reduced tremor as compared to placebo. Odds ratio are large with small uncertainty; thus, we can infer that drug may be developing tremor for some patients.

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 7, fig.width = 7}
forest(model10, sortvar = model10$TE.random[,which(colnames(model10$TE.random)=="placebo")])
```
